# Visual Studio Theme Color Tester
Can be used to remap all color references in a .vstheme file.
This allows you to find what element might need to change in a Visual Studio theme. (After taking a screenshot of course and grabbing the hex color of the element you are interested in)

For example:
```
      <Color Name="ComboBoxListItemBorderHover">
        <Background Type="CT_RAW" Source="FF7F6AAA" />
      </Color>
```

... or... you can always use it as an ugly theme generator.
